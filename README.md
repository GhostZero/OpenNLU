# OpenNLU - Open Source Conversational AI

> There is currently no release candidate available.

OpenNLU (Natural Language Understanding) is a tool for intent classification and entity extraction. You can think of OpenNLU as a set of high level APIs for building your own language parser using existing NLP and ML libraries.

OpenNLU is used to build next-generation bots and assistants that engage in human-like, layered conversations.
